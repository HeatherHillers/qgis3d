# QGIS 3D

Simple proof of concept built with Qt 3D to evaluate the possibility of using Qt 3D framework for 3D map view in QGIS in the future.

The demo application creates a terrain model from a DEM raster layer and applies aerial imagery as texture of the mesh.

The viewer allows basic interaction: keyboard arrows and page up/down to move camera, drag left mouse button to change camera orientation.

Tested with Qt 5.8 on Linux.
